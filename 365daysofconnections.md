# 365 Days of Connections [2021]

## Motivation: 
As covid-19 danced around the world, 2020 has been a tough year all the way. It has been especially limiting for people looking to travel and making new connections. However, it also made us understand how connected we are due to technology, arguably more connected than ever. Hence "#365 days of connection" is my commitment to move past the circumstances and building a richer connection pool for everyone.
